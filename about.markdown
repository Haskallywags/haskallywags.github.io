Haskallywags was originally a group book club to go through [Haskell From First Principles](https://haskellbook.com).
When that wrapped up, the focus expanded to be a pan-functional meetup group based in Madison, WI.
There were a few talks that were live-streamed but it was still pretty meatspace-centric back in the beforetimes.
